This is just a repo for me to practice writing C using some exercises from the classic Kernighan
and Ritchie book, The C Programming Language 2nd Edition.

Each directory contains exercises from a different chapter. Each exercise will have its own 
subdirectory containing the code, some test cases, and a short readme descring how to compile and
run it.
